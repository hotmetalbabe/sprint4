# sprint4 project
This project contains Real Madrid (football club) wage information by player for the last 5 seasons.
Users are able to filter the dataframe by each column and/or parameters included in said columns.
The project also includes 3 charts, two histograms and one scatterplot which visualize wage/season information.

If someone wants to run this on their local machine, simply clone the repository, head to your terminal, navigate to the directory and run the 'streamlit run app.py' command.
